        <h3><strong>Hi, I'm Andy Brooks. Welcome to my homepage.</strong></h3>
        <br>
        <p>I'm a graduate mathematician from Bath University with</p>
        <p>more than 35 years' experience of teaching and tutoring</p>
        <p>maths in the northeast of England. I have worked in 5 local</p>
        <p>secondary schools, including Stokesley, Nunthorpe, Thirsk</p>
        <p>and Northallerton. I have been a Chief Examiner, and I have</p>
        <p>had responsibility for writing examination papers at both</p>
        <p>GCSE and A level. I was also a member of the AQA examiner</p>
        <p>team that developed the current new A level Mathematics and</p>
        <p>Further Mathematics specifications, which were first examined</p> 
        <p>in 2019.</p>

          <p>If you're studying maths at A level and looking for some</p>
          <p>extra support, then let's have a conversation about how</p>
          <p>I can help you to achieve your maths goals. </p>

          Here are just a few ways in which I can make a difference:
          <ul>
            <li>I can re-explain a topic that you've found hard, then choose sensible questions for you to try, to build your confidence and ability</li>
            <li>I can give you help with answering difficult problems, by explaining the key facts and methods you need to use</li>
            <li>I can deconstruct exam questions, with hints and tips, so that you can gain confidence in knowing how to begin (and complete!) your answer</li>
            <li>I can help you to develop your maths memory, so that you build the maths knowledge that you need to have at your fingertips</li>
            <li>I can guide you to structure your learning, so that you increase your skills and understanding without increasing stress  </li>
            <li>I can help you to navigate your way through the many past exam papers, so that you focus on the right questions at the right time</li>
          </ul
